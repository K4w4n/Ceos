      "indignation and dislike men who are so
      beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
      foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
      duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
      are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and
      when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
      pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
      will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
      always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
      pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
