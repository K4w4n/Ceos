        <span class="text">"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
            beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
            duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
            are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and
            when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
            pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it
            will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
            always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
